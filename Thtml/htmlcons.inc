        be supported, undefining this constant will allow Metafiles to be
        displayed.

{
Using Third Party Controls

Unfortunately, the VCL controls that come with Delphi do not handle Unicode well.
In fact, in many cases, they do not work well with multibyte fonts either.  For
this reason, provision had been made to use either the TNT or Elpack third party
controls.

The TNT controls may be obtained at
http://home.ccci.org/wolbrink/tnt/delphi_unicode_controls.htm.  They are
freeware.  They handle Unicode well in Win2000 and WinXP (probably NT also).
However, with Win95/98 they are not Unicode but do handle multibyte and other
character sets well with the exception of UTF-8.  The TNT controls do not work
with Delphi 4.

The Elpack controls may be purchased at http://www.eldos.org/elpack/elpack.html.
For use with the HTML Components, the item you will want is the "LMD Elpack 4.0
Standard VCL".  The Elpack controls are fully Unicode for Win95 through WinXP.

Either of these control sets may be used by defining the appropriate compile
time constant, "UseTNT" or "UseElpack".  You can define these in htmlcons.inc or
in the Project|Options dialog, Directories/Conditionals tab.  Be sure and do a
complete Build on your application after changing these compile time constants.

htmlsub.pas defines five new symbols to represent the form controls.  These are
ThtEdit, ThtButton, ThtMemo, ThtCombobox, ThtListbox.  The definitions of
these symbols change with the set of controls being used.  So, for instance,
ThtEdit is the same as TEdit for the Delphi controls but becomes TTntEdit when
UseTNT is defined or TElEdit when UseElpack is defined.  If your application
accesses the form controls for special purposes, it would be best to use these
new symbols.  For example code like,

      if TFormControlObj(Items[I]).TheControl is TEdit then
        TEdit(TFormControlObj(Items[I]).TheControl).Text := ........

might be better written as:

      if TFormControlObj(Items[I]).TheControl is ThtEdit then
        ThtEdit(TFormControlObj(Items[I]).TheControl).Text := ........
}
