Approach to Select options for dialogs

* Common unit to be used with any command
    dialog_common_select_model
    dialog_common_select_view
These are structured just like existing

* Existing units must reference these
    cmd_contribution
Create instance of the model
Create view as with other intrinsic views
Add function to assess IsDefined for all models based on array of defined flags
generate_script must put select first if it exists

* in TStatDialog.UpdateButtonView
Create array of defined flags, based on existing models
Call cmd_contribution . IsDefined(Is DefinedFlags: Array of Boolean) : Boolean

* Select view
Has 1 variable drop down, 1 comparison dropdown and 1 constant
Comparison dropdown different for numeric and string

* Select model
Is defined only if all three dropdowns are set

* Next
If this works, apply same principle to Variable List, for Freq and Describe, maybe CTable
